Development: Each service can be developed independently using its own docker-compose.yml
Testing: Main repo contains docker-compose with all services for integration testing
Production: Kubernetes manifests in main repo reference Docker Hub images
CI/CD: Each service builds/deploys independently, main repo orchestrates full deployments

Service Communication
Your current setup is good - the Order Service calls the Product Service via HTTP. For development:

Local Development: Use docker-compose networks for service discovery
Production: Use Kubernetes services and ingress
Configuration: Environment variables for service URLs (already implemented)

Database Strategy
Since you mentioned the database init is in another repo:

Development: Each service has its own PostgreSQL in docker-compose for isolation
Integration: Main repo coordinates shared database
Production: Single PostgreSQL instance with proper schema management

This approach allows each service to be developed independently while maintaining the ability to integrate them in the main project repository.
